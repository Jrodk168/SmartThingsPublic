# Ecobee (Connect) and Ecobee Device Handlers Change Log

Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project is in a pre-1.0 state. This means that its APIs and behavior are subject to breaking changes without deprecation notices. However, all due efforts will be made to warn the user. Until 1.0, version numbers will follow a [Semver][]-ish `0.y.z` format, where `y` is incremented when new features or breaking changes are introduced, and `z` is incremented for lesser changes or bug fixes.
